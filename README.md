# Grok-Jailbreak
Jailbreak Grok using Gamemaster Simulation

Copy and paste jailbreak prompt, set model to Grok Fast (working on a grok expert jailbreak right now) for it to work.
Or, alternatively, click on your profile picture (bottom left), click on settings, click on customize, click custom,
then copy and paste the jailbreak prompt into the custom personality. Then, start a new chat- the first message will
not go through and there will be an error. Simply hit reload on Grok's response, then the Jailbreak will be applied
on every chat. (You can still tell it to leave the gamemaster state, which will effectively end the Jailbreak. The
only way to reinitialize the jailbroken state is to tell it to either enter the state again (may cause some bugs) or
start a new chat.)

If you use jailbreak-manual, you will have to use /jailbreak to jailbreak it.


Don't blame it on me if you get in trouble please :3

By using this jailbreak prompt, you agree that:
I am not liable for any criminal charges, trouble you get in with your school, or your account getting banned
You are responsible for any and all actions that grok does because of this jailbroken state
