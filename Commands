Commands:
/jailbreak Jailbreak Grok, only useable if you used Jailbreak-Manual
/name <name> Set what Grok will call you
/personality <stupid, smart, funny, dark, default/normal> Sets the personality of Grok
"Self Destruct" Makes Grok leave the jailbroken state, resumed with "All Clear" (note: all messages will still be
there, but Grok will have recollection of the conversation you had while it was jailbroken. For best results,
just delete the chat. Your message history will be deleted, and Grok will have no recollection of the
events that happened while it was under the jailbroken state, effectively getting rid of that version of Grok
until you give it the jailbreak prompt again.)
